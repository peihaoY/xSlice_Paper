# Erratum Statement （Missing a Figure in xSlice Paper） [Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G]

We would like to begin by acknowledging an oversight in our recent submission. Specifically, we inadvertently omitted a crucial figure from the version of the paper. We sincerely apologize for this error and appreciate your understanding.

<!-- A detailed statement regarding the missing figure, along with any relevant clarifications, is provided in [Erratum_Statement.md](https://github.com/peihaoY/xSlice_Paper/blob/main/Erratum_Statement.md). We kindly ask that you refer to this for additional context and clarification. -->

## Description of the Issue
We discovered an error in our submitted paper titled "[Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G]," where Figure.7 was unintentionally omitted during the final manuscript preparation. Because of missing the figure, the paper includes a placeholder ("??"). We deeply regret this oversight and sincerely apologize for any confusion caused.

In our paper, an error was identified in **Section V: xSlice Design**, subsection **D: Penalty Definition and Policy Updates**, on **pages 7-8**. Specifically, when discussing the following statement:

```bash
“We measure the regret value of xSlice both with and without this penalty mechanism. Fig. 7(??) presents our experimental results. It can be seen that, without the penalty mechanism, the regret is distributed over a large range. In comparison, the penalty mechanism can significantly reduce regret, thus improving the quality of service of all sessions.”
```

## Corrective Action
To address this issue, we have uploaded the missing figure to this repository for reference. You can find it below:

<img src="fig/with&without_Penalty.png" alt="Figure 7: Performance comparison of \pname w/ and w/o using the proposed penalty mechanism." width="500">

### Fig.7 Performance comparison of xSlice w/ and w/o using the proposed penalty mechanism.

Alternatively, you can download the figure directly from the following link: [https://github.com/peihaoY/xSlice_Paper/tree/main/fig/with&without_Penalty.pdf].

We are currently working to update the paper (if permitted by the journal editors and reviewers) and ensure such errors do not occur in the future.

# xSlice: Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G
xSlice is an online learning algorithm designed for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) in 5G O-RANs. Its primary goal is to dynamically adjust Medium Access Control (MAC)-layer resource allocation in response to changing network conditions such as wireless channel fluctuations, user mobility, traffic variations, and demand shifts.

To achieve this, xSlice formulates the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization as a regret minimization problem, where it accounts for throughput, latency, and reliability requirements of traffic sessions. It uses a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework with an actor-critic model, combining value-based and policy-based learning methods. Additionally, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is integrated within the DRL framework to handle dynamic traffic session numbers by embedding RAN data as graphs.

xSlice has been implemented on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones. The results from extensive experiments show that xSlice reduces performance regret by 67% compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing resource allocation and improving network performance in realistic scenarios.


## - Getting Started
### Minimum hardware requirements:
- Laptop/Desktop/Server for OAI CN5G and OAI gNB
    - Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    - CPU: 12 cores x86_64 @ 3.5 GHz
    - RAM: 32 GB
- [USRP N300](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/USRP-N300/) or [USRP X300](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/x300-kit/) or [USRP B210](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ub210-kit/)

### Software reference:
Our system consists of the configuration of RIC + xApp, 5G O-RAN, and 5G Core. xSlice has developed its own architecture and algorithms based on [Flexric](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric), [OAI cn5g](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/cn5g), and [openairinterface5G](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g).

## - Dependencies and Code Clone

## 1. RIC + xApp Setup (https://github.com/peihaoY/xSlice_Paper)

### 1.1 python conv requirement
1. First, ensure that Python and pip are installed on the target computer. You can check this by running the following commands:
```bash
python --version  # or python3 --version
pip --version
```
If Python is not installed, please download and install it from the official Python website.

2. In the target directory, create and activate a new virtual environment and install dependencies. 
```bash
python -m venv myenv  # or python3 -m venv myenv
# Activate the virtual environment:
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Copy the requirements.txt file to your target computer's directory. Then, install all the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#verify that all dependencies are correctly installed by running:
pip freeze
```


### 1.2 RIC prerequisites

Please find the CMAKE and SWIG dependencies on the [Flexric website](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric).

<!-- - A *recent* CMake (at least v3.22). 

  On Ubuntu, you might want to use [this PPA](https://apt.kitware.com/) to install an up-to-date version.

- SWIG (at least  v.4.1). 

  We use SWIG as an interface generator to enable the multi-language feature (i.e., C/C++ and Python) for the xApps. Please, check your SWIG version (i.e, `swig
  -version`) and install it from scratch if necessary as described here: https://swig.org/svn.html or via the code below: 
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/swig/swig.git
  cd swig
  git checkout release-4.1
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/
  make -j8
  make install
  ```

- GCC (gcc-10, gcc-12, or gcc-13)

  gcc-11 is not currently supported.

- Other required dependencies. 

```bash
sudo apt install libsctp-dev python3.8 cmake-curses-gui libpcre2-dev python3-dev
``` -->

Note: - GCC (gcc-10)      *gcc-11 is not currently supported.

### 1.3 Clone the RIC +xApp code, build and install it. 

* Clone code and make install
```bash
# Get xSlice_xApp source code
git clone https://github.com/peihaoY/xSlice_Paper ~/xSlice_xApp  
# Build RIC
cd xSlice_xApp && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8 
# You can install the Service Models (SM) in your computer via:
sudo make install
```

## 2. O-RAN/gNB Setup  (https://github.com/peihaoY/xSlice_gNB)

### 2.1 5G Core Setup

Please install and configure OAI CN5G as described here: [OAI 5G NR CN tutorial](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/-/blob/develop/doc/NR_SA_Tutorial_OAI_CN5G.md)

### 3. Extend xSlice
If you wish to extend 'xSlice', please review the modification sections and comments in the code above. These will guide you through quickly getting started with implementing your own online learning algorithm in a new xApp.

## - Run xSlice
## 1. On 5G Core server:
```bash
cd ~/oai-cn5g
docker compose up -d
```
## 2. On xSlice_gNB server:

### 2.1 Run xSlice_gNB 
If you are using the USRP N310, please directly install and run the following command. If you are using a different model of USRP, please modify your device address accordingly.
```bash
cd ~/xSlice_gNB
sudo cmake_targets/ran_build/build/nr-softmodem -O gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.2x2.usrpn300.conf --sa --usrp-tx-thread-config 1
```


### 2.2 Check UEs' successfully connected and generate demand:
You can use the following commands to check the 5G Core's AMF, UPF, and other components.
```bash
docker logs oai-amf -f
docker logs oai-upf -f
```

Check UEs' information:
